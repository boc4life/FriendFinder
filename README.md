# FriendFinder  

FriendFinder is a survey website designed to match users with their closest match in the API. Upon submitting the survey, the user's inputs will be compared to previous respondants, and a modal will be displayed with their match's name and photo.  

Styling done through Bootstrap, and the design and layout were intended to copy that of the example website provided by the assignment.

Primary focuses of the assignment were to practice routing through Express, custom API creation, and deployment through Heroku.
